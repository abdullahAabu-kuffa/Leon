# Leon - Portfolio Website Description

Leon is a responsive and visually clean personal portfolio website built entirely with HTML and CSS. It showcases my frontend development skills and serves as a professional landing page for potential clients, employers, and collaborators.

The site includes:

🧑‍💻 About Me – A short introduction and background

🛠️ Services – What I can offer

💼 Portfolio – Project samples or featured sections

📩 Contact – A section to connect with me

Designed with a mobile-first approach and clean semantic HTML structure, the website is lightweight, fast-loading, and easy to navigate. It's hosted using GitHub Pages for accessibility and version control.
